- first we will populate a 4x4 table with random letters

- user will select either a horizontal group or vertical group of consecutive letters in the jumble

- program will create two strings:
          one string will be the collection of letters selected
          the other string will be the reverse of the first string


  -  program will then compare both strings to every word in the dictionary

+points are scored in increasing order with each new board.  for example, the first word you find will be one point,  the second word you find will be 2 points, and so on.. added your total score

#button: shuffle, will reset board are score count with another set of random letters.  when this happens, your scoring begins at one again (but your total score is preseved)


  -  if there is a match, then the word disappears off the table and new letters take the words place.

-  game ends when enough words are found.
    game will total your score and compare it to others.
