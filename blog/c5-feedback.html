<h1>The Pairing and Feedback cycle</h1>
<h4>January 15th, 2015</h4>

<h2>Pairing</h2>
<h3>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h3>
<p>One of my main issue coming into this program is that I'm used to programing on my own, and working with others usually means asking questions or answering questions.  When I'm actually pairing with someone here, we're exchanging ideas, and concepts (with most pairs), and I very much appreciate the opportunity to work with others and accomplish something (that at this point I could have done on my own) and come to a more concise and interesting solution that I would never have come to on my own.   </p>
<h3>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h3>
<p>Learning things from others and being able to teach what I know is extremely rewarding to me.  The exchange of ideas that both expands my knowledge base and accomplishes a mission is invaluable to me.  It's so hard to find people that are working on the same programs your working on, in DBC everyone is working on the same thing, so it's quite easy to find someone to partner up with.</p>
<h3>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h3>
<p>I'd say the only frustrating thing, for now at least, is the connectivity issues I've been having with Yosemite.  Its a lot better now, but during my early pairing sessions I would periodically get disconnected from the session, while my partner is explaining something, then I would come back 20 seconds later and have to frustrate them by telling them that I just lost connectivity and asking them to repeat the last 20 seconds.  Hopefully this won't be an issue once we start on-site pairing.</p>
<p> The other way we pair is in person, usually and the Crepe 3 house on Valencia, and while in person pairing is better because connectivity is not an issue, and its easier to explain and listen with out lag, it does get pretty noisy and busy in the place of meeting, and the huge TVs with the football games on them tend to distract my attention.</p>


<h2>Feedback</h2>
<h3>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h3>
<p>Reading feedback is a very vulnerable experience.  I have my own opinions about myself and my performance, so its a bit of a culture shock to hear what people anonymously think of me.  Nothing too bad has been written, and I quite enjoy both compliments and critiques.  Compliments help reinforce me positively and critiques tell me what I need to do to improve.</p>
<h3>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h3>
<p>Like I said, I appreciate both positive and negative aspects of my feed back.  When I get negative feedback I really go out of my way to take the advice.  It's extremely help to hear what people think of me, it's out of my comfort zone, but I think it makes for a better programmer in me.</p>
<h3>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h3>
<p>One of the main complaints I get is that I move too fast for them, and thats just because I know we have an hour for the exercise.  But I've been making a concentrated effort to slow down and let my partner take the lead.</p>
<h3>How was it to write feedback?</h3>
<p>Reading feedback and especially negative feed back is extremely helpful to me, so naturally writing feedback is my way of paying the favor forward.  I think its my duty to be completely honest as well as respectful to my pair.  Although the feedback is anonymous, based on the timing of the reception and the specific things mentioned, you can usually deduce who it is, so I try to be nice and constructive.</p>
<h3>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h3>
<p>At times I feel compelled to look for something negative to say about my partner, because I don't think its fair to them to just shower them with compliments and not have anything constructive to give, but I rarely have anything negative to say.  All my partners have been very receptive to my ideas, and had no problem voice their own concerns or ideas.  But then again, I've only paired with one partner more than once, so mostly it's been just our first meeting.  I'm sure the honeymoon phase of acquaintanceship will wear off by the 3rd or 4th time pairing and people will become more comfortable with me and start to let their bad habits show, and give me something to call them on during feedback.</p>
