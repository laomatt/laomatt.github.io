      <h1>What language are you speakin', man!?</h1>
<p>The program, or issue, I decided to blog about for this entry is the problem of many different and competing languages.  Before starting DEvBootCamp I was in an android programming program and CCSF.  I finished my cert, but in my last class the teacher, trying to sell us on taking more classes, told us that Java, a language that I just spent a little over a year deeply burrowed in, isn't enough to get us a job.  We need to couple it with other languages and qualifications (none of which were offered in the program).  Needless to say, I left in pursuit of DevBootCamp, and started spending more time learning ruby, only to look on line and not see so many job opening for a ruby programmer (although hopefully I'll sort that out in career week.)  After being on a few job interviews and being told of .NET, python and others, I came to the conclusion that its rare that two companies have the same language makeup.
</p>

<p>It seems that interviewers (who usually aren't coders themselves) can be very picky about what languages you know.  It could be very nerve racking to spend a great deal of time to learn something to a proficient level, only for every 5th person to tell you that some other programming language is what you should be learning.
</p>

<p>Concluding this entry, I have realized that every language has its own community of coders and they all have their uses in different situations.  For example, Java is use for more back end programming, while ruby is more popular with startups, on account of it's simple and quick implementation.
</p>

<p>But whatever language you choose, the key, from what I've gathers from other industry programmers is this:  Learn the core skills, and concepts and keep building your knowledge base.
</p>
<p>Too many people get into a profession for nothing but the paycheck.  I still believe programming to be an art form.  If people can't embrace that then there is no room for them in the industry, in my opinion.  Part of any art form is the ability to keep learning and growing and expanding your knowledge base.  If people get too comfortable in one comfort zone, because they are making money, or it suit their needs, or what ever the case may be, then they are really cheating themselves out of other ways of solving a problem.
