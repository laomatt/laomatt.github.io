<h1>Conflict</h1>

<h4 class="blog_date">Febuary 14th, 2015</h4>
<h3>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
</h3>
<p>A few years ago, while at the gym, I was in the weight room, in a medium crowded day at the gym.  Needless to say, all the bench press benches were all taken up, so I  ofund myself patiently waiting for a bench to open up.</p>
<p>I noticed one bench not being used, except for two guys standing next to it having an enlongated conversation.  All the while not actually using the bench to excercise, but instead having a really long and engaging excercise.</p>
<p>So I initiate contact with these two gentlemen and ask them if I could possibly use the bench.  To my dismay they said 'no, we're using this right now.'  Then after a while I came back to find them still having a conversationg around the bench, and NOT using it!  So I asked them if I could atleast work in.  They refused again, saying 'sorry man, we're not done yet.'  I was a little irked by the  refusual, because it, by gym ettiquette is highly unusual, people are usually open to being considerate to others.  </p>
<p>So while I was sitting and waiting, getting madder and madder I started to notice things about them.  They were not gym regulars, just new years resolutioners, or gym tourists that kind of use the space as a hangout spot to make themselves feel more in shape than they actually are.  I started listening in on their conversation and found that it was one of the most bro-tastic conversation ever.  </p>

<p>These guys wern't regs.  They wern't even there to excercise, but just to hang out, which would have been just as fine if the gym wern't so crowded!  Plus it was a sunday, sundays are supposed to be chill workouts, but for some reason the gym was chocker boxed full of tech-hipsters like these guys.  Thats another thing I was doing out of anger, I was making up this back stroy for each of them to make it more enjoyable for me to hate them.</p>

<h3>What was the source of the conflict?</h3>

<p>Looking back on it, the main source of this conflict (which was actually pretty one-sided) was just me not wanting to change up my workout routine, or cut it short any.  I had a set plan for what I was going to do that visit, and I didn't want to deviate from it.  These two were getting in the way of that.  Sure I could have done something else then come back, but there was no garuntee that I was going to be able to use that bench.</p>

<h3>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h3>
<p>
The main thing about this situation was the fact that I felt so disrespected by these two.  Somehow their conversation was more important than my gym time.  As if I don't pay the same gym dues that they do, or that I'm somehow trespassing on their territory, and they can't be bothered to even come up with a better excuse than saying "nah, man, we're using this" as they blatantly continue not to use it.</p>
<p>I also felt a fair bit of uncertainty in regaurds to my own schedule, and how long I wanted to spend at the gym.</p>

<h3>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</h3>
<p>Basically I just took a step back and realized that there were two other benches at that gym.  So patience was key to avoiding taking tht conflict even further.</p>

<h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h3>
<p>I would have gone to a different gym.</p>

<h3>What did you learn from this experience?</h3>
<p>Patience, everything ends sometime.  Another bench opened up and I was able to use it, and solve my problem.</p>
