<h2>REALEASE 3: (Values)</h2>


<p>There are times in my life where I've felt proud of myself, and its only in those moments where you can actually appreciate the things in your life that help you get there.</p>
 <p> -Creativity,  I think the one thing that keeps me programming, or at least drives me to do more and more is my natural creative personally.  I never just code, I make things that require me to code...  I've been a painter, and digital artist, a UI designer and even once long ago a musician.. (please don't ask me which instrument I played. ), but now, I'm rehashing a skill that I first learned when I was 14, and took a class in this wonderful new thing called "HTML" and I got into building my own websites.  I left that behind when the dot com bubble popped, and moved into majoring in Math in college.</p>
 <p> One thing I noticed about math is that when you get into the upper level courses, it becomes very abstract, to the point where no-body ever needs to use a calculator.  Its becomes all about the ideas behind numbers and equations, and how creatively you can prove a lemma, or theorem.  I felt nothing when I was graduating on stage,  but my proudest moments (because I'm a huge nerd) were those late night and early morning study-group sessions, and library study groups from class, where I was with other math majors, discussing and commiserating over ideas and algorithms that made me look at the same thing from multiple angles.  It gave me the same high that painting a picture does.  I felt so productive, and thats a good feeling to me.</p>

  <p>-Growth:  feeling productive with my day is also a big driver to me.  If I know more today, than I did yesterday, then I consider the time spent in between a success.  The main way growth made me satisfied with myself, is just the feeling to getting something done.</p>

  <p>-Self-knowledge: I think that the main thing that separates students achievement levels with the same material is the students knowledge of his or her own learning style.  For example I know that I am really slow with lectures and reading, I'm more of a code and experiment, then research, then experiment type learner.  Other people learn a lot from readings.  The problem arises when students leave their learning comfort-zone, which is a good thing to do every once in a while, find things are more difficult, and don't make an effort to revert back to what they know, while retaining any lessons learned from the experience.  Only you know how best you learn, and everyone has their own rituals, and should build upon them, not try and fit in to what others may do.</p>

  <h2>REALEASE 4:  advice</h2>

  <p>-The last time someone asked me for advice it was a few people, mostly with their solo-games.  Self-knowledge was important, but it was more about knowledge of the person I was talking to.  Some of them have a certain way of studying, I just kind of introduce my own way of learning to see if they are open to the more experiment-research type of learning environment.</p>

  <p>I was happy I was able to answer their Java-script questions, as I am new to Java-script myself, but I've been crash coursing on it for the past 3 days, designing my own solo game.  So in this regard growth was a really important confidence booster, and allowed me to talk in a more knowledgeable way (even though I may only be just a little more knowledgeable than the person I am helping at this stage in my Java-script career)</p>

<h2>Release 5: Values and Stereotype threat</h2>

  <p>Last week we learned about the 'stereotype-threat' complex, and how it could be crippling, as well as empowering sometimes for some people.  As I said in conclusion, I like to be judged by the example that I set, and not the popular view on what ever demographic I might be in.  I feel that showing my values is a very real way to me to combat stereotype threats.</p>
  <p>I expressed concerns about being judged before people meet me.  But I try not to let it effect me, neither positively or negatively.</p>
