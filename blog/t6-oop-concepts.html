      <h1>You down with OOP?  Yeah you know me! </h1>
      <h2>Ruby Modules vs. Classes</h2>

      <h3>Why use a Ruby Class?</h3>

      <p>So like my other blog <a href="t5-ruby-classes.html">post</a> states, a class is a template for an object.  The main purpose of a class is to make objects based on itself.  It's like a cookie mold, making multiple cookies of the same shape.  One of the other uses a class has is to group variables, constants and methods that are linked to each other in some way.  Sort of like a package, but a package that you can't open, unless you clone it and open the clone.  In other words you can't directly access things in that class without making objects from that class.</p>


<h3>What does a Ruby Class look like?</h3>
<p>Your standard ruby class is a collection of variables(or fields) and methods.   </p>

<div id="example">
<PRE>
0:
1: #I made this new class
2: class Food
3:   attr_accessor :typefood
4:   attr_accessor :dirty
5:
6:   def initialize(name, leftover)
7:     @typefood=name
8:     @dirty=leftover
9:   end
10:
11: end
</PRE>
</div>

<p>In the above example, my Food class makes food objects.  Each object is initialized with a name stored in the attribute 'typefood' and what kind of crumbs they leave behind stored in the attribute '@dirty'.  (An attribute is a variable with class scope, so in this example, both my attributes are accessed with an attr_accessor).</p>

<h3>What does a Ruby Module look like?</h3>

<p>A module is ruby is basically structured the same way most of everything else in ruby is structured.  There is a header and an 'end' statement to signal we are at an end of the construct.  Within those keywords reside the body of the construct, in the case of a module, this consists of constants, classes and methods. </p>
<p>Take for example a file called <b>module_demo.rb</b></p>
      <div id="example">
        <h5>--disclaimer -- this code was originally taken from <a href="http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/chapters/35-modules/lessons/80-modules-as-namespaces">Ruby Monk</a> and modified for my own purposes --</h5><br><br>
        <PRE>
0:
1: module Matt
2:   def Matt.add(num1, num2)
3:     return num2+num1
4:   end
5:
6:   TANG="matt"
7: end
8:
9:
10: module Lao
11:   def Lao.add(num1, num2)
12:     return num2+num1*6
13:   end
14:
15:   TANG="lksdfjs"
16: end
17:
18:
19:
20: module RubyMonk
21:   module Parser
22:     class TextParser
23:       def self.parse(input)
24:         # define method
25:
26:         input.upcase.split("")
27:       end
28:     end
29:   end
30: end
31:
32:
33:
34: module Kata
35:   A = 50
36:   module Dojo
37:     B = 9
38:     A = 1
39:
40:     class ScopeIn
41:       def push
42:         A
43:       end
44:     end
45:   end
46: end
47:
48: A = 10
49:
</PRE>
</div>

<p>As you can see, the modules encapsulate a variety of different objects, from methods to constants, variables are stored inside classes which are stored inside the module.</p>
<p> Now lets play around with our code with some driver tests.  In this case we have a file for my test drivers for it:</p><br><br>

<div id="example">
require_relative 'module_demo'<br>
<br>#this first call did not work
#p RubyMonk::Parser::TextParser.new.parse("matt")<br>
p RubyMonk::Parser::TextParser.parse("matt")<br>
<br>
</div>
<p>Notice how the first method call didn't work, what happened?  How do we fix this?</p>
  <h3>We had to take the 'new' keyword out</h3>
    <p><b>why?</b>  Parse is a factory method, (because of the 'self.' keyword), therefore it does not have to be part of an object to be called, instead it may be called directly from the class in the module.  In this case, the class TextParser, inside the module Parser, inside the module RubyMonk.
    modules contain Constants, methods and classes... but not variables.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Now, further down our test file we have:</p>
<div id="example">
#this first method call did not work<br>
#p Kata::Dojo::ScopeIn.push<br>
p Kata::Dojo::ScopeIn.new.push<br>
</div>
<p>Again, the first method call did not work.  </p>
<h3>We had to put the 'new' keyword in</h3>
    <p><b>why?</b> Scope in is a method that is <i>not</i> static, or it does not belong to the class, but rather an instance of that class (an object made from that class).  Therefore we must first instantiate an object (this is what the 'new' keyword does), then call the push method of that object that was just created.<br><br>
    <b>note: </b> the object is anonymous, because we never gave it an actual variable name, thus it takes up no space in memory.  After this command is executed from this temporarily instantiated object, the object effectively disappears, and memory is freed up making it advantageous to processing speed to use anonymous objects when ever possible...</p><br>

<h2>Why use a Module?</h2>

      <p>A class is a very useful construct, but it is not used as a package for items, and you can't group a class inside another class.  Again, a class is sort of like a package that you need to clone in order to open.</p>

      <h3>What are Ruby Modules used for?</h3>
      <p>Modules are the packages in the Ruby language, or you can think of them as file-cabinets.  Modules are a way to avoid collisions in the namespace.  Module are also a way to group and call logically related constants, methods and classes.</p>

      <p>You call things in a Module via the '::' operator, which tells Ruby to look up the pro-ceding item in the Module with the name of the preceding item.  This is useful for grouping items and calling them by group, kind of like putting things in folders and directly calling them in those folders.</p>
<h3>Avoiding namespace collisions </h3>
<p>To directly call a method that sits inside, on the first level, or a module, simply use the '::' operator in order to locate the method.  The syntax follows: 'Module_Name::Thing_your_looking_for'.  The more levels the object is down, the more '::' we to use.</p>

<p>Back in the test file we have:</p>

<div id="example">p Matt::add(3,4)  #=>prints out 7</div>

<p>now if I had another method named 'add' (because it does the same thing almost), to avoid collisions in the name space , I could put that extra 'add' method into another module called Lao (like I did in module_demo.rb), while my original 'add' method is still in the Matt module.  To call each method, I would first have to call the Module, then use the :: operator to search with in that module.</p>


<div id="example">p Lao::add(3,4) #=>prints out 22</div>

<p>The same principle follows for the constants name TANG in each module.  Each module contains a constant named TANG, if we were to call the TANG inside Matt module, we would have to call it like this:
<div id="example">
  "puts Matt::TANG" => prints "matt"
</div>
  <p>while</p>

<div id="example">
  "puts Lao::TANG" =>prints "lksdfjs".
</div>
