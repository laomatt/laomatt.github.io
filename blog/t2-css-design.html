          <h1>Week 2: CSS design</h1>
          <h2>CSS class vs. IDs</h2>
          <h4>December 22nd, 2014</h4>


          <p> This week was our first foray into true website design, in our introduction to the concepts of cascading style sheets, or CSS for short.  In designing my website, via tables, I found that I wanted every space on the site to have specific styles.  This is where the concept of CSS ids and classes become important.</p>

          <p>The difference between the two was not clear to me in the begining.  I was thinking, wow I have two identifiers that I can use to specifiy different styles.  At first I was having alot of trouble referencing IDs and Classes in my CSS file, until I had a peer pairing session with Tim Steele, on the CSS/ blog template challenge.  He told me the different ways to access both of my stylesheet, first off IDs are referenced with a '#', and Classes are referenced with a '.'(period).  </p>

          <p>So then I thought: Great!  now I know how to refernce different classes and IDs in my stylesheet!.....  But wait a minute, why are there two different and unique identifiers?  Surely there has to be a reason for this.  Then I did some further research into the subject.  From the internet I found that it is suggested (but so far doesn't seem required) that elements that use the ID identifier are for very specific situations in which you want something that shows up once in the page.  (eg.  the title, navigation bar, logo, etc...) and by contrast, the class identifier is for elements that are repeatedly used multiple times on the same page.</p>

          <p>In conclusion, I feel more confident about CSS, knowing the difference between the two types.  I still don't know any concrete reason why you couldn't use the two interchangably, it must be something that is noticable when the website grows bigger and the CSS file is linked from more HTML pages.</p>
