<h1>Git, GitHub and Version control</h1>
  <h2>What I Learned in week 0 of DBC	</h2>
  <h4>Dec 10, 2014</h4>

  <section>
    <p>So Basically, this week was was crash course in some of the most important tools in communal coding that I never heard of: git.</p>
    <p>At first I thought git hub was just another place where people can upload things, and download it else where, sort of like hotmail accounts and dropbox, but I soon realized that, when used with git, it’s so much more than that.</p>
    <p>1.)  The ability to push large amounts of changes at once</p>
    <p>Gone are the days where everything must be uploaded, either individually, which can be time consuming, or in a batch which requires and ENTIRE site be re-uploaded and overwritten, which is also time consuming.  No more will you have to scour your file tree in order to single out the files that were changed, only to not be sure that these changes were saved, or the correct version of what you coded.  With the push command in git, you can upload everything you have staged and commited.</p>
    <p>2.) The ability to go down multiple development paths at the same time, then pick and choose.<br>
      <br>
      Git calls this version control.  It basically like a tree of branches (which is where git gets it terminology from), the several versions are split off from a master branch, and they each evolve their own way, and just as the word ‘evolve’ would suggest, only the best branch (or version) of the same program will be selected while the rest can be discarded.  This, I find, is the best way for things to naturally evolve in nature, so naturally it should be the best way for our programs to evolve too.</p>
    <p>3.) the ability to go back to a previous state.</p>
    <p>This is basically like hitting the undo button in photoshop, except for a near unlimited amount of time (I only say ‘near’ just because my brain hates handling infinity).  Committing regular is a good habit to get into, but make sure to only commit something that works, theres nothing more frustrating than to restore to a previous state only to find that the place you came back to doesn’t work.</p>
    <p>4.) Why Store on github?</p>
    <p>Say you computer is lost, or stolen, or someone with the mutant ability to create and manipulate magnetic fields comes across it and decides to wipe out your hard drive?  Then what?  Well, if you’ve been saving on github you (and your teammates) can easily continue working on you program and code like nothing ever happened.  Sell the program, and then buy an even better computer with the profits.  Basically github is an all in one: security system, sharing environment, learning environment, and a more efficient alternative to e-maililng or drop boxing code to everyone you need to.</p>
