      <h1>Ruby classes, and what they do</h1>
      <h4 class="blog_date">January 17th, 2015</h4>


<h2>Classes are a way to group attributes together</h2>
<p>One of the first things to notice about classes is that they are nothing but collections of things.  Fields and Methods.  Fields can be thought of as adjectives while Methods are verbs.  Unlike other languages such as Java, Ruby does not require us to use classes to call methods and fields (or variables), but it is required for making objects, which I'll get into later in this post.  As a default setting, methods and variables declared outside of classes are made in something called a main Object, that everything runs on.</p>

<h3>How to call methods and variables in a class</h3>
<p>To access an attribute (or thing) in a class, we must first make an object of that class.  Then that object will inherit all the attributes of that class (as well as all the attributes of that classes super class), and we can access its methods via the '.' method, also known as the 'call' method.  For example, 'Umbrella.open' calls the 'open' method in the 'Umbrella' object.</p>

<p>Another notable difference in Ruby from other languages is that everything in Ruby is an object, so we can't directly call a method in a class (static methods), methods must first be assigned to a object before they can be used.</p>

<h2>Classes produce objects</h2>

<p>If class Fields are adjectives, and Methods are Verbs, then the Objects that those classes produce are the nouns of the Ruby language.  Think about it:  then you think of a person, place or thing in any spoken language, they are usually each associated with their own sets of attributes (adjectives and verbs).  They each have a unique description of things about them, and they each have a set of actions they are capable of doing.  For example, a car has thing about it that are similar to fields, for example, the color, the make and the model.  Every car has these attributes but in different descriptions.  One car is a green Honda civic, another might be a red Dodge charger.  They all have verbs or actions associated with them, for example a 'drive' method, which all run differently based on each cars 'engine' field.  The main function of classes is to produce objects.  </p>


  <p>Classes are templates for new objects.  Everything in Ruby is an object, and classes are where objects come from.</p>

<p>Take a class called 'Matthew' (modeled after myself):</p>

<div id="example">
<div id="eg">My Matthew class has 5 fields associated with it (name, face, clothes, job, location,) and 6 methods (5 of them setter methods for the fields that we can replace with an attr_writer), making for a totally or 11 attributes.  </div>
<PRE>
0:
1:
2: class Matthew
3:
4: def initialize
5:   @name="unknown"
6:   @face="unknown"
7:   @clothes="unknown"
8:   @job="unknown"
9:   @location="unknown"
10: end
11:
12: def setname(name)
13:   @name=name
14: end
15:
16: def setface(face)
17:   @face=face
18: end
19:
20: def setclothes(dress)
21:   @clothes=dress
22: end
23:
24: def setjob(occ)
25:   @job=occ
26: end
27:
28: def setlocation(place)
29:   @location=place
30: end
31:
32:
33: end
34:
35: def introduce_self
36:   "Hi, my name is #{@name}, and I am a #{@job}<br>, living in #{@location}, on my face I have #{@face}.<br> I wear #{@clothes}."
37: end
38:
39: end
</PRE>
</div>



<p>Now this is an example of a class, that has a collection of attributes, that every object created from this class will have.  Now lets create an objects</p>

<div id="example">
Matt=Matthew.new<br>
Matt.setname("Matt Lao")<br>
Matt.setlocation("San Francisco")<br>
Matt.setjob("DBC student")<br>
Matt.setface("thick eyebrows and stubble")<br>
Matt.setclothes("plain t-shirt and jeans")<br>
</div>


<p>now I create another object from this class to describe myself in high school:</p>

<div id="example">
highscoolMatt=Matthew.new<br>
highscoolMatt.setname("Night Terror")<br>
highscoolMatt.setlocation("the abyss of color and emptyness")<br>
highscoolMatt.setjob("goth raver")<br>
highscoolMatt.setface("heavy eye-liner and black lipstick")<br>
highscoolMatt.setclothes("baggy raver pants and a long black trenchcoat")<br>
</div>


<p>now I create another object from this class to describe myself in college:</p>



<div id="example">
collegeMatt=Matthew.new<br>
collegeMatt.setname("Mattyboy")<br>
collegeMatt.setlocation("the college commons")<br>
collegeMatt.setjob("parttime student, part-time Ultimate Frisby champ")<br>
collegeMatt.setface("a really long bushy beard")<br>
collegeMatt.setclothes("cargo shorts, sandals and graphic tees")<br>
</div>

<p>So in summary I just created three versions of myself, from a class I made to model myself.  And each object has an introduce_self method that introduces themselves based on the attributes that each where given when they were created:</p>

<div id="example">
puts Matt.introduce_self<br>
=>Hi, my name is Matt Lao, and I am a DBC student,
living in San Francisco, on my face I have thick eyebrows and stubble.
I wear plain t-shirt and jeans.<br><br>


puts highscoolMatt.introduce_self<br>
=>Hi, my name is Night Terror, and I am a goth raver,
living in the abyss of color and emptiness, on my face I have heavy eye-liner and black lipstick.
I wear baggy raver pants and a long black trench coat.<br><br>


puts collegeMatt.introduce_self<br>
=>Hi, my name is Mattyboy, and I am a part-time student, part-time Ultimate Frisbee champ,
living in the college commons, on my face I have a really long bushy beard.
I wear cargo shorts, sandals and graphic tees.<br><br>
</div>

<p>And there you have it, three completely different versions of me, created from me, or a template of me... yea... that sounds right..</p>

<p>They all have inherited the 'introduce_self' method, but they all have different outputs for that method, why?  Because that method, depends of the attributes of each object.  They all share the same fields, but each have different values for those Fields, so their output for the method will be structured the same, but with different details.</p>
