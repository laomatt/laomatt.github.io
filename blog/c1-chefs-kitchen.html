<h1>Kitchen vs. Table learning</h1>

    <p>A table mentality in regards to learning is a very common way to think,  and its how we are all programmed to think (well most of us) whether it be from parents, or teachers.  On the other hand a kitchen mind set is more intuitive, experimental and most of all, its creative.</p>
    <p>It’s important to look at devbootcamp as an opportunity.  Not a program to go though.  I know thats a little strange to say about a program and teaches … well.. programming, but hear me out.</p>
    <p>We have to break away from the usual idea of education, that tells us that as long as we do good on a test, we’re educated,  which is simply not true.  Thats a lazy way of learning and an extremely lazy way of teaching.  Students become afraid to experiment and learn on their own to the point that they can’t open a soda bottle without someone telling them to.  I only say that because I remember an incident in kindergarten where I actually asked for permission to open a juice box while at lunch!</p>
    <p>As a society we’ve been hypnotized into ‘drone’ learning, that does nothing but kill education and weakens our future economy.</p>
    <p>A program like this is perfect for my learning style.  Most of what I know about anything are things I found out by doing things.  For example when I was learning how to draw and paint, I really sucked at first,  I realized that I could only listen to so many lectures on the subject, but without all the practice and hours I put into it I wouldn’t be anywhere near as comfortable and proficient with the craft as I am today.  The very fact that I can say that about myself with out feeling a little pretentious is evidence of all the hours I put into learning it.  (Because you can’t work that hard on something and not call yourself proficient) </p>
    <p>As someone who learns very little from lectures, and learns the most from practice and doing,  I wouldn’t know half the things I know without all the man hours spent in front of my drawing table experimenting with different digital painting techniques, mixed media techniques, etc..  and I only hope I can bring that same philosophy to this program.</p>
    <p>Personally I don’t care about grades or scores, or even diplomas, all I care about is what I can do and create after a program has run its course.  I’m a creative person with a flair for logic and mathematics.  I will always consider myself an artist first.  Creativity and innovation is the most important thing for me to learn and cultivate.</p>
    <p>I would say that I am pretty nervous though.  This is a huge financial gamble for me, but I make up for that in my wanting of more knowledge and more ways to create things that are of use to people.  Hopefully I can translate hunger for a job into real creativity when it comes to my web apps.</p>
