      <h1>Stereotype threat</h1>
      <h3>January 29, 2015</h3>

      <h2>What is Stereotype threat?</h2>
      <p>The threat of conforming to a stereotype for fear of destroying the reputation of the group.  This has two parts to it: </p>

      <p><b>(1) a human beings need to be an individual:</b> Everyone has the basic human right to autonomy, and naturally actively peruses this right.  It was leads to revolutions and wars throughout history.  When we are unfairly grouped into masses, some element of choice is inherently taken away from us, and its a primal instinct to want as many choices as we can have.</p>


        <p><b>(2)human beings need to do whats best for him/her AND the group (in this case whatever demographic of person he or she belongs to):</b> human beings are in fact social animals, we have evolved to work in teams and take pride in those teams, strengthening bonds between individuals.  But with this pride comes a responsibility we all feel to protect the reputation of the group.</p>

          <p>In both cases being aware of stereotypes and subconsciously spending extra energy into actively avoiding those stereotypes, sometimes doing the complete opposite in order to try and destroy it seems like a colossal waste of time. </p>
      <p>A stereotype threat can be best summed up in the following skit: </p>
  <p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PZwdQK9I20" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It can be crippling to have something like that continually hanging over your head.  Unlike whats covered in the skit, I believe positive stereotypes to be just as crippling as negative ones.</p>

<h3>Why do people stereotype?</h3>
<p>People operate in a very computeristic fashion when it comes to large uncountable quantities of data.  The amount of people that the average person meets in their life time is one of these quantities.</p>
<p>In most ways, its just easier on the brain the generalize and stereotype, as a sort of filtering mechanism, so that we are able to make choices faster.  I'm not defending stereotyping, but I do understand it.</p>

<h2>My own fears about it</h2>

<p>  I fear the positive stereotypes just as much as the negative stereotypes.  I get no kind of stereotype boost out of it.  I fear that people want to expect more out of me, and have this entire back story assumed about me, prior to ever meeting me.  If anything I get a little bit of a stereotype threat when I answer a question I know, or finish an assignment early, just because I don't want to perpetuate a stereotype that society seems to accept so freely, thus robbing me of any kind of individual credit.  All of a sudden it becomes a product of my cultural background, instead of a product of me just working hard at it.
</p>

<p>I fear that people compare me to other Asians and Pacific islanders, which makes it really hard finding a job because of racial and gender quotas and affirmative action.  I get no kind of lift or boost from any of those stereotype because they have never been me.  I never grew up with a "tiger mom" (I fucking HATE that term), my mom was a single working mom, and I was a latch key child growing up in the Bayview district.  Everything I was ever good at I got because I spent the hours and energy to learn it, while others around me consistently made the wrong choices.  I went through the same schools, and failed the same placement tests in college, had to take remedial math because of the quality of education I received in an inner city school. But I dug my way out of it by working hard on my own, eventually graduating with a degree in math.</p>

<p>All of a sudden that gets taken away from me because I happen to have an Asian last name.  People who don't know any better think I have the "smart-gene".  People I've met usually had their own interpretations about me and my life, and assumed I was an overachiever, and unlike other stereotypes, they were never shy about voicing their views.  I think 'positive' stereotypes like this are just as damaging as negative stereotypes.  When an individual gets judged based on how people perceive the group they belong to.  This type of stereotyping is EXTREMELY harmful to a job search.</p>

<p>I see stories about media hogs like Jesse Jackson and Al Charlatan (I know thats not his last name, I'm making a joke) complaining that the tech industry doesn't have enough people of color, I can't help but to know that when they say 'people of color', they don't mean me.  While I agree that the tech industry needs to be more diverse, both gender wise as well as culture wise, what we should be focusing on is exposing inner city kids of all cultural backgrounds to computer languages earlier, the same way we introduce them to reading different books.  We are approaching a society in which the Internet and knowing how to navigate a computer is every bit as important as reading a book.  If we start introducing hiring quotas based on gender and race, and not based on skills and knowledge, that threatens to destroy the whole industry.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I get really irked when ever I see anyone making generalizations about any group of people, in any way.  All I asked is to be judged as an individual.</p>
